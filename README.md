## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript with LocalStorage

### What I learned

I was able to learn more about Javascript DOM as well as a little bit of Object-Oriented Programming and using LocalStorage.

### Continued development

If this will be continued to a larger project, I think it will be great if the admin can add more reward items. Also, the bookmark button currently only toggles into a green button but does not add the link to the bookmarks of the browser.
